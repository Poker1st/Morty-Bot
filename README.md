The preferred way to deploy this Bot is via Heroku. Using Heroku means that the bot doesn't run on your computer,
is active 24/7 and you don't have to worry about the ffmpeg installation, which is messy. Therefore this installation guide is
going to describe how to do it.

Heroku is a service which provides servers and much, much more. Depending on your needs, the server (a.k.a. Dyno)
is free of charge the time writing this guide, it will cost you **nothing**. You should create a Heroku account before proceeding.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/razum90/SupahBot/tree/master)

After deploying, click manage apps and "Configure Dynos", and make sure "worker node Bot.js" is switched on.

## The accounts (needed to fill in the config variables on the Heroku deploy)
- A new discord app (Bot)
- A google developers account (to get a youtube API key to use for the bots playback service)
- A openweathermap account (to use the bots weather service)

Creating these accounts will cost you **nothing** aswell, by the time writing this guide.

### Step 1
- Navigate to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and create a new App
- Create a bot user
- Reveal your token by clicking "click to reveal" right next to "Token"
- Save this token somewhere
- Copy your client ID and visit https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=268561430,
  replacing "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" with the client ID copied
- Join your server

**NOTE: The bot can run without the weather and the playback service!**

### Step 2 (Recommended)
To be able to use the music playback service you need to create a google developers account
- Go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and create and account if you don't have one
- Create a project
- When created, navigate to "Credentials" and create credentials (API key)
- Save this key somewhere

### Step 3 (Recommended)
To be able to use the weather service you need to create a openweathermap account
- Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up and create an account
- When created, navigate to API keys and create one
- Save this key somewhere
